# Search OS X Terminal commands using Alfred 2

Use this workflow to search OS X Terminal commands by keyword and paste the command into Terminal.

## Usage
Type `cmd [keyword]` (or set your own shortcut) to search available terminal commands. Press `ENTER` to copy the command to the clipboard and paste it in the front-most app (e.g. Terminal).

## Install

Clone this repo and double-click the `alfred-terminal-commands.workflow` file or download [just the workflow file](https://github.com/gnestor/alfred-terminal-commands/raw/master/package/alfred-terminal-commands.alfredworkflow).

## To do

* Display the `--help` docs for selected command

* Display the `man` docs for selected command

* Generate personalized index for user/system using `compgen -ca`
